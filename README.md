# K-map-automation
A python script designed to take functions as input, calculate the truth table, generate the respective K-map and show the simplified equation automatically.

# Next Goal
1) I am planning to modify my functions to also support direct maxterm or Minterm indexes as input.
2) Since the GUI part is designed by AI, there's no changes necessary there. However, as for the logic, the AI has told me to include the process of simplification.
   As of now, I do not possess the knowledge to display the simplification itself. Hence, I'll use AI for this part. But even with AI, showing the full process is
   gonna take time. It won't be hard because I won't have to do the thinking part but it will take time.

Note: If all goals are completed, this app can technically become what it is meant for "K-map automation". Once 100% complete, any questions of K-map from the first
semester of "Foundations of Computer Science" can be solved. As for the further complex questions, we'll see what happens. Thank You.
